# project iot web-dev with golang(on going) and javascript as backend

## What is this?

This is a mini IoT project combined with web development.
I use javascript language as web server and also rendering html and css to browser with endpoint `localhost:4000`.

I named this mini project: IoT remote controller via website and sensors on arduino.

## Hardware Tutorial

please refer to see the tutorial development iot with arduino on medium. this link : [IoT remote controller via website and sensors on arduino](hardware.md).

## How to use?

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies

```bash
cd javascript
npm install
```

2. Run `npm start` to start the backend server

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open `localhost:4000` in browser (cannot be used yet / still in development stage), but you can use `cd/javacript/view/features/lampu` and open `index.html` in browser

4. You can control your IoT device via your browser

## Note

Please come back again to see more complete features because this is still under development.
